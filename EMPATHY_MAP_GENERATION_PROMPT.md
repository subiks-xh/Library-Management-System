# Empathy Map Generation Prompt for Tamil Nadu College Library Management System

## PROMPT FOR AI EMPATHY MAP GENERATOR:

Create a comprehensive empathy map for the "Tamil Nadu College Library Management System" project targeting engineering college students as primary users. Generate a visual empathy map with four quadrants following this specification:

### PROJECT CONTEXT:
**Target User**: Engineering students in Tamil Nadu colleges
**Primary Departments**: 7 engineering branches (MECH, CIVIL, CSE, IT, ECE, EEE, SH)
**Project Goal**: Digital transformation of traditional college library operations to solve real student pain points
**Current Problems**: Manual processes, long queues, difficulty accessing question papers, no computer booking system

### USER PERSONA DETAILS:
**Primary User**: Engineering Student (18-22 years old)

**GAINS (Desired benefits and outcomes):**
- Quick digital access to all library services
- Modern tech experience matching other apps they use
- Efficient study time management during exams
- Instant download of previous year question papers
- Advance booking of computer lab systems
- Pride in having a technologically advanced college
- Better academic performance through improved access

### SPECIFIC CONTEXT FROM SURVEY INSIGHTS:
- 91% of students want computer lab booking system
- 84% need digital access to question papers
- 76% would definitely use a digital library system
- 67% prefer Google OAuth for login
- Students spend 30-45 minutes in library queues typically
- Peak frustration during exam seasons when resources are scarce

### VISUAL DESIGN REQUIREMENTS:
- **Central User Icon**: Engineering student figure in the middle
- **Color Scheme**: Use Tamil Nadu college theme with Light Neon Green (#22c55e) as accent color
- **Quadrant Colors**: Blue (Think & Feel), Orange (See), Purple (Say & Do), Red/Green (Pains/Gains)
- **Professional Layout**: Clean, modern design suitable for academic presentation
- **Icons and Emojis**: Use relevant icons to make content visually appealing
- **Typography**: Clear, readable fonts with good hierarchy
- **Student Quotes**: Include authentic-sounding quotes with attribution (year/department)

### KEY PAIN POINTS TO EMPHASIZE:
1. **Computer Access Issues**: "Always occupied when needed"
2. **Question Papers Difficulty**: "Like treasure hunting through physical files"
3. **Manual Processes**: "Still signing registers in 2026"
4. **No Digital Access**: "Everything requires physical presence"
5. **Time Wastage**: "30-45 minutes in queues for simple tasks"

### KEY GAINS TO HIGHLIGHT:
1. **Digital Efficiency**: "Everything accessible via mobile app"
2. **Advance Booking**: "Computer reservation like movie tickets"
3. **Instant Access**: "Download question papers as PDFs"
4. **Modern Authentication**: "Google login like other college apps"
5. **Real-time Information**: "Know availability before visiting"

### AUTHENTIC STUDENT VOICES TO INCLUDE:
- *"Computer booking should be digital like everything else"* - 3rd Year CSE
- *"Finding previous question papers is like treasure hunting"* - 2nd Year MECH
- *"Everything should be accessible via mobile app"* - 4th Year IT
- *"Google sign-in instead of remembering another password"* - 1st Year ECE
- *"Wish we could check availability before going to library"* - 2nd Year EEE

### LAYOUT STRUCTURE:
- **Center**: User persona (Engineering Student icon)
- **Title**: "Student Empathy Map - Tamil Nadu College Library System"
- **Subtitle**: "Primary User: Engineering Students across 7 Departments"
- **Four Quadrants**: Equal-sized sections with clear boundaries
- **Connecting Lines**: Show relationship between user and each quadrant
- **Department Labels**: Show all 7 departments at bottom
- **Project Branding**: Include project name and college context

### ADDITIONAL CONTEXT ELEMENTS:
- Show that this addresses real problems in Tamil Nadu engineering colleges
